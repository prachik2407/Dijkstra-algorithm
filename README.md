# Dijkstra-algorithm
Python Code
The code I've posted is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a famous algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. Initialization: It starts by initializing the distance to the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.

2. Priority Queue: It uses a priority queue to keep track of nodes to be visited next, where the node with the smallest distance has the highest priority.

3. Exploration: While there are still nodes in the queue, it dequeues the node with the smallest distance, and for each of its neighbors, it calculates the distance through the current node. If this distance is less than the currently known distance to the neighbor, it updates the shortest distance and adds the neighbor to the queue.

4. Termination: The algorithm continues this process until the queue is empty, at which point it has found the shortest distance to each node reachable from the start node.

In code, I've used a graph represented as a dictionary of dictionaries, where the outer dictionary's keys are the nodes and the values are inner dictionaries. In these inner dictionaries, the keys are the neighboring nodes and the values are the weights of the edges.

The output of your code indicates the shortest distances from node 'A' to all other nodes in the graph. For example, the shortest distance from 'A' to 'E' is 9. This is calculated as the sum of the weights along the shortest path from 'A' to 'E'.
